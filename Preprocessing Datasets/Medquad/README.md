## Medquad Preprocessing


Two ipynbs:

- one preprocessing part 1. Converts files to train.json. 
- one is specific to LLMs. NOTE: This is a repeat of what we do while running bloom... Just though it also belonged here. We had shared this bloom_train.pkl with some more LLMs

Both: Pretty self explanatory

More info available in the report in the main readme.
